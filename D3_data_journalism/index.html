          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Healthcare Access & Income</h2>
          <p>There appears to be a correlation between the population that haus a lack of healthcare and the poverty rate for 
            individual states. States that have a lower poverty rate also have higher rates of access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>The data also seems to show two large grouping of states. The first grouping happens between a poverty rate of 11% 
            and 14%, and the second groupoing happens between 15% and 17%. Both groups have a access to healthcare % between 6% 
            and 8%.</p>

          <p>There are two extremes in the datapoints. 12% of New Hamphires populations lacks healthcare, but they have a new zero 
            poverty level. West Virginia and Kentucky have very high poverty levels, but a relatively low percenatge of the population 
            has a lack of healthcare, compared to other states.</p>
